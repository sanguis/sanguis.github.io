Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a huge part of a DevOps tranformation in an organzation. It is a tool that can quickly who where piles ups of work (WIP) happen.

The primary challenge of VSM for me is that I am a total non visual person. I use VI and perfer to so all my writting in Vi. I would create a YMAL doc and pase it than use Excel. Do a [quick search](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Value+Streem+Map) of Value Stream maps and you will see heals of beutifully designed flow charts. The propect of doing that sort of my think is way out of my comfort zone.

The other challenge is that in my current organzation has alot of processes to map. I have a QA group a Release engeneering group, at least but not limited to 4 teams of feature developers. All togather there are probally over 100 people with their own unque view of how things work. I want to be able to see how people work diffrently, I want over time for theret o be a way to create changes and hypothisis's about how we work and how we work togahter.
