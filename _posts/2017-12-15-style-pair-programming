A  colleague of mine recently as asked me to distill my 'mob  programming guidelines' into shorter chunks of information. Also to make  and make it start with 2 people, for a ramp up for pair to mobbing over time as a team desires.

This process has been defined as 'Strong Style' Pair Programming.

In this style of pairing, all logic gets vetted by two brilliant minds as it is developed.

## Benefits of Strong Style Pairing

* Two Heads are better then one.
* Velocity will not suffer if a team member leaves.
* Rapid mutual education of paring partners.
* Less Errors get committed.
* All participants are full engaged at all times.

## Two roles of strong style pairing
 
**Navigator**: The person dictating and the the most focused on the big picture logic. They will be hands free or have a machine open for research purposes.

**Driver**: The person at the keyboard.  They focus on the micro goals of proper syntax and  cleanliness of code.

## Talking Up to your pair
 
**Intent → Technical → Dictation**

When giving directions it is best to start with your intent over syntax. Drivers may have other methods of achieving the same result then the navigator. Coding in a process that they are familiar with is more efficient than having to lean the drivers methods. 
This also promotes the education of the Navigator of new methods.

A sentence with "In Order to, do a task, please do this" is a great starting point.

Drivers should feel free to ask how or clarification. Let them prompt for a technical hint or dictation, rather then assuming they do not know.

## Ideal pair programming starter sessions.
Pair Programming can be awkward at first the bellow items are good for rapid rapport building between developers.

* Code Refactoring
* Pseudo Coding
* Unit Test writing
