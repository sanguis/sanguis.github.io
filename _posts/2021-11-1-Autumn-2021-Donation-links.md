Hey All,

I have two fundraiser 5 k's links for you. Here's the deal. I sweat and hurt, and you get to feel good knowing you funded a good cause.

My first link is to raise money for Safe passage. They are an org that helps victims of domestic abuse escape from harms way.

The second is for the Hill town land trust. Anyone who knows me knows I love my home in western MA. it's one of the most beautiful places around.
The hill town land trust protects our most unreparable of resources. Our earth.

Help me protect it with more than just my registration fee.
